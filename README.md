Canvas File Manager eliminates the frustration of a cluttered Downloads folder by changing how students interact with course materials. By automatically identifying the course name and file metadata directly from the Canvas interface, the extension ensures that every file is saved in a perfectly organized subfolder structure on your computer, such as Canvas Files/Physics 101/Lecture.pdf. Most importantly, it tracks your download history; if you have already accessed a file, the extension provides an "Open File" button to launch your local copy instantly, preventing the creation of annoying duplicates like Syllabus(1).pdf and saving you the time spent hunting through a messy file system.
